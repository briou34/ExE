# Bear hunt

## Simple

Some bear advice all,

Use your strongest heroes if you are creating a rally.

If you are joining the correct heroes to use are:

Chenko
Yeonwoo
Amane
Amadeus
Hilde

This is because the top right skill is used when you join a rally and they have guaranteed damage, the other heroes have a chance skill which means it isn't always applied.

Archers make the most damage so where you can your ratio should be 10/10/80 but this isn't always possible so use where you can.
If you have more marches than heroes just send troops.

## Detailed

Bear Hunt is a team coordination event to maximize rallies in a pure offensive manner.

First, here a few points on rally mechanics:

Rally leader:

- The stats and bonuses of the rally leader apply to everyone in the rally
- All expeditions skills of all heroes of the rally leader apply to the battle

Rally joiners:

- Stats and bonuses of rally joiners do NOT apply
- Only the first expedition skill of the first hero of rally joiners might apply to the battle
- Only the 4 highest-level first skills among joiners will be effective

Considering this, to have the best impact for you and everyone here, you should:

- Stronger players should launch rallies with their strongest heroes
- Joiners should ONLY join rallies with an offensive first hero (Chenko, Yeonwoo, Amane, Amadeus, Hilde)
- Better NO hero for joiners than a non-offensive first hero (we don't want a lvl 5 Jabel skill to override a lvl 4 Chenko skill)
- Your best formations should have offensive heros, higher level troops, and up to a 10:10:80 troops ratio, put remaining troops in formations without hero
