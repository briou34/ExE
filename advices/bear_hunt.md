# Bear hunt

## Simple

Some bear advice all,

Use your strongest heroes if you are creating a rally.

If you are joining the correct heroes to use are
Chenko
Yeonwoo
Amane
Amadeus
Hilde

This is because the top right skill is used when you join a rally and they have guaranteed damage, the other heroes have a chance skill which means it isn't always applied.

Archers make the most damage so where you can your ratio should be 10/10/80 but this isn't always possible so use where you can.
If you have more marches than heroes just send troops.

## Detailed

Bear Hunt is a team coordination event to maximize rallies in a pure offensive manner.

First, here a few points on rally mechanics:

Rally leader:

ðŸ”¹ The stats and bonuses of the rally leader apply to everyone in the rally
ðŸ”¹ All expeditions skills of all heroes of the rally leader apply to the battle

Rally joiners:

ðŸ”¹ Stats and bonuses of rally joiners do NOT apply
ðŸ”¹ Only the first expedition skill of the first hero of rally joiners might apply to the battle
ðŸ”¹ Only the 4 highest-level first skills among joiners will be effective

Considering this, to have the best impact for you and everyone here, you should:

ðŸ”¸ Stronger players should launch rallies with their strongest heroes (except Chenko, Yeonwoo, Amane)
ðŸ”¸ Joiners should ONLY join rallies with an offensive first hero (Chenko > Yeonwoo > Amane)
ðŸ”¸ Better NO hero for joiners than a non-offensive first hero (we don't want a lvl 5 Jabel skill to override a lvl 4 Chenko skill)
ðŸ”¸ Your best formations should have offensive heros, higher level troops, and up to a 10:10:80 troops ratio (infantry:cavalry:archery), put remaining troops in formations without heros
