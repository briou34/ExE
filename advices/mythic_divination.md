# Mythic divination

## Explanations

This is a monthly event that lasts 2 days, and you can get about 23 free Fortune Tokens per day.
22 from Daily Missions and 1 from the Fortune Token Pack section.

In cumulative token cost, when resetting after X flips:

| #Flips | Flip cost | + Reset cost | Total | Token / flip |
| ------ | --------- | ------------ | ----- | ------------ |
| 0      | -         | 15           | 15    | -            |
| 1      | 1         | 14           | 15    | 15           |
| 2      | 3         | 13           | 16    | 8            |
| 3      | 6         | 10           | 16    | 5.33         |
| 4      | 10        | 6            | 16    | 4            |
| 5      | 16        | 5            | 21    | 4.2          |
| 6      | 24        | 4            | 28    | 4.66         |
| 7      | 36        | 3            | 39    | 5.57         |
| 8      | 51        | 2            | 53    | 6.625        |
| 9      | 71        | 1            | 72    | 8            |
| 10     | 96        | -            | 96    | 9.6          |

So it makes no sense to reset before flipping 4 cards.
After that, only flip a few more if there is worthy rewards left or if the 4th card was a multiplier.

F2P:

At 20 and 100 tokens used, you get chests with respectively 5 and 12 tokens back.
So as a F2P, you better skip every other event to be able to go for 100 flips (e.g. ~ 16 * 6 flips) and save 17% of tokens.

The cost in token per flip (+reset) decreases until 4 cards are flipped, after that it increases.
So it makes no sense to reset before flipping 4 cards.
After that, flip only a few more if there are worthy rewards left or if the 4th card is a multiplier.

This is a monthly event, you will get ~45 free tokens during the event.
At 20 and 100 tokens used, you will get back 5 and 12 tokens in chests.
So you might aim to do 100 flips (e g. ~16\*6) in a single event to save 17% of your tokens.
It means that you may want to skip the event if you don't already have 55 tokens in your backpack before it starts.
