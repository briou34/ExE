# Pets

## Advancement

2 main facts at play:

- The higher the color of the pet, the better the stats gain per level up;
- Medaillon are hard to get, and they are needed to advance pets from level 50 onwards.

So:

Gen 3:

- Every pet should be leveled to 40 at least
- Tier list for level 50+ advancement:
  - Joiners / F2P: Lion > Cheetah > Bison > Wolf > Lynx
  - Leaders: Lion > Cheetah > Moose > Bear > Bison > Wolf > Lynx

Gen 4:

- Every pet should be leveled to 50 at least
- Tier list for level 60+ advancement:
  - Joiners / F2P: Lion > Mighty Bison > Cheetah > Bison > Wolf > Lynx
  - Leaders: Lion > Mighty Bison > Rhino > Cheetah > Moose > Bear

## Timing Marks

To improve the stats gain per Timing Marks spent:

- Start with the white tier of lower rarity-pets, until you get to green tier, then move up to the next rarity pet and repeat.
- If you run out of pet with white tier stat bars, then move on to the next lower rarity pets with green tier stat bars, then blue bars etc.
- Save Advanced Taming Marks for the harder to complete tier like purple stats bars.
