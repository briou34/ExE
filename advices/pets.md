# Pets

To improve the stats gain per Timing Marks spent:

- Start with the white tier of lower rarity-pets, until you get to green tier, then move up to the next rarity pet and repeat.
- If you run out of pet with white tier stat bars, then move on to the next lower rarity pets with green tier stat bars, then blue bars etc.
- Save Advanced Timink Marks for the harder to complete tier like purple stats bars.
